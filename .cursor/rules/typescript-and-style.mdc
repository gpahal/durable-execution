## TypeScript

- Use the package-local `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.build.json` for compiler settings.
- Strict typing; avoid `any`. Exported APIs should have explicit types.
- Tests can rely on `vitest/globals` (configured in `durable-execution/tsconfig.json`).

## Linting

- ESLint config comes from `@gpahal/eslint-config/base`:
  - Core: [durable-execution/eslint.config.mjs](mdc:durable-execution/eslint.config.mjs)
  - Other packages inherit similar config files.
- Run `pnpm lint` and fix with `pnpm lint-fix`.

## Formatting

- Prettier with `@gpahal/prettier-config` and `@ianvs/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`.
- Use `pnpm fmt` or `pnpm fmt-check` at repo root.

## Testing

- Vitest config is shared via re-export:
  - Source: [durable-execution/vitest.config.ts](mdc:durable-execution/vitest.config.ts)
  - Re-exports: `durable-execution-orpc-utils` and `durable-execution-storage-drizzle`.
- Run tests with `pnpm test`; coverage with `pnpm test-coverage`.
