### CI and Codecov

- **Workflow**: [run-tests.yml](mdc:.github/workflows/run-tests.yml)
  - Installs with pnpm, runs `pnpm test-coverage` at repo root
  - Uploads two Codecov reports with flags:
    - `durable-execution/coverage/coverage-final.json` → flag `durable-execution`
    - `storage-drizzle/coverage/coverage-final.json` → flag `storage-drizzle`
  - Uses `codecov/codecov-action@v5` with `fail_ci_if_error: true`

- **Expectations**:
  - Each package must emit `coverage/coverage-final.json` for CI to upload
  - Flags enable per-package reporting/thresholds in Codecov UI
