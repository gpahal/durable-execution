## Drizzle storage package

- **Purpose**: Drizzle ORM-backed storage for `durable-execution`.
- **Entry**: [durable-execution-storage-drizzle/src/index.ts](mdc:durable-execution-storage-drizzle/src/index.ts); drivers for PG/SQLite in sibling files.
- **README** has usage examples for all three databases: [README.md](mdc:durable-execution-storage-drizzle/README.md)

### Implementor tips

- Export created tables (e.g., `createDurableTaskExecutionsPgTable`) so Drizzle can discover schema.
- Create storage via helpers like `createPgDurableStorage`, `createSQLiteDurableStorage`.
- Ensure transactional semantics match `DurableStorageTx` expectations from core package.

### Dev commands

- Build: `pnpm -F durable-execution-storage-drizzle build`
- Test: `pnpm -F durable-execution-storage-drizzle test`
- Use root scripts for lint/type-check with `-F` as needed.
